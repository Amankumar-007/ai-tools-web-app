# Image Generator Setup Instructions

To get the image generator working, you need to set up your Google Gemini API key:

1. Get your Gemini API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create a file named ".env.local" in the root of your project
3. Add the following line to your .env.local file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

4. Restart your development server

Note: The .env.local file should already be in your .gitignore, so your API key won't be committed to version control.

If you don't have a Gemini API key, you can sign up at https://makersuite.google.com/ and get free API access to start.
